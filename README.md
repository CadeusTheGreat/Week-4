# Week-4
## What was the challenge?
The challenge was to create a playbook that would install and start docker.

## How did I expect the challenge to go?
I expected the challenge to go well as I had practiced before hand with installing docker through ansible.

## What went well?
Installing docker via an ansible playbook went well and functioned as expected. It appears to install correctly however the service will not start properly at the end of the playbook.

## What didn't go well?
There was a fair amount of time spent on debugging the playbooks final few lines of code referring to starting a service. I'm not sure as to why it would not execute and the error was not descriptive.

## Future Improvements
Find out what the error thrown means and fix the code so that the docker service starts.
